   <center> <h1> SWORDS </h1>
    <p>A sword is an edged, bladed weapon intended for manual cutting or thrusting. Its blade, longer than a knife or dagger, is attached to a hilt and can be straight or curved. A thrusting sword tends to have a straighter blade with a pointed tip. A slashing sword is more likely to be curved and to have a sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade. Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing. The precise definition of a sword varies by historical epoch and geographic region.</p>

<h2> History Of Swords</h2>
<p> /The history of swords can be traced back to the Bronze Age, when they evolved from daggers and were first created by blacksmiths in Ancient Egypt around 1150 BCE. Swords were a common weapon before the invention of guns and were adopted by other cultures that quickly spread their use.</p>
